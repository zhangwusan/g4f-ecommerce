This cleansing oil effectively removes makeup and impurities without stripping my skin of its natural moisture. Infused with moringa oil and a blend of probiotics, it not only cleanses but also nourishes the skin, leaving it feeling soft and refreshed. The lightweight formula emulsifies easily with water, making it easy to rinse off without any greasy residue. I’ve noticed an improvement in my skin’s texture and clarity since incorporating this product into my regimen. It’s suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin, and I appreciate that it’s vegan and cruelty-free. Overall, I highly recommend the AXIS-Y Biome Resetting Moringa Cleansing Oil for anyone seeking a gentle yet effective cleanser.<br><br><a class=\"item_use_view_image\" data-index=\"634947\"><img alt=\"IMG_35351740077977608.jpeg?f=webp&amp;amp;w=200\" src=\"https://d2c3d01lcpw2ui.cloudfront.net/gl/data/editor/2502/IMG_35351740077977608.jpeg?w=200&amp;q=80&amp;f=webp\"/></a>\n</br></br>",
