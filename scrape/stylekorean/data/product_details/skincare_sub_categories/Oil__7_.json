Despite being an oil, it absorbs quickly and doesn’t feel greasy at all. I use it as the last step in my nighttime routine or mix a drop with my moisturizer. It helps lock in moisture and makes my skin look more radiant and smooth. The black rice extract gives antioxidant benefits, which I love. It’s great for dry patches or dull skin, and it doesn’t clog pores. It has a light natural scent that fades quickly. A really elegant facial oil.</span></p><div><span><br/></span></div>",

The concentrated 100% rosehip oil, cold-pressed from natural rosehip fruit grown on the Andes, moisturizes skin leaving it nourished and supple. \r\nThe Cold press method extracts the active ingredients of natural raw materials using solely physical pressure with no high heat applied. AROMATICA Organic Rosehip Oil hasn’t undergone the processes of decolorization or deodorization which gives it a unique reddish color and minimizes the destruction of the nutrients such as Chlorophyll and Tocopherol. \r\nMore than a superfood, Rosehip has 20 times more vitamin C, A, B, E, and P than lemon. A refreshing, moisturizing formula gives the feeling of the combination of serum and oil! Incredibly moisturizes skin inside out even with a small amount. It is suitable for all skin types including dry..\nSuggested Use\n\r\nWarm 1-2 drops of organic Rosehip oil in clean palms and gently press onto face, allowing it to fully absorb into the skin.\r\n* For best results, mix a few drop of the oil with less oily lotion or cream to give your skin an extra boost of moisture.\nIngredients\n\r\n\r\nOrganic ingredients 100%\r\n*Rosa canina fruit oil *Organic raw material(s)",
