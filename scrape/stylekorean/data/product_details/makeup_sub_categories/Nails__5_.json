        "content": "Sigh I hate to leave an average review but this particular nail set was average at best. The gem included is super hard to adhere as a sticker due to the curvature of the nail bed and often there are air bubbles on the side which do not look pretty especially when it’s set with the curing light. I’m extremely disappointed with EDGEU for reformulating their gel stickers because they reduce the number of stickers available compared to the old version - you might not find a sticker which fits your nail. Bring back the old version please. <br><br/><a class=\"item_use_view_image\" data-index=\"484127\"><img alt=\"1704431420_1.jpeg?f=webp&amp;amp;w=200\" src=\"https://d2c3d01lcpw2ui.cloudfront.net/gl/data/editor/2401/1704431420_1.jpeg?w=200&amp;q=80&amp;f=webp\"/></a>\n</br>",
