It even made me actively and vigoriously claw my head with my fingernails because of how tough and frustrating it made scrubbing my scalp - which ended up making me lose tonnes of hair as a result. I eventually found out that I have to do 2 rounds of shampoo from another brand before using this one (for the 3rd round) will even remotely spread and clean as well as any typical shampoo brand. Due to the extremely poor experience, I gifted it to my mom who enjoys it (says its just like a normal shampoo, so I guess it was the powdery sweet scent that made her like it). If she hadn't liked it as well, I alone would've given this product a 1 star. It gives me extremely low expectations for any other product of this brand.

It works wonders for my dry, damaged ends, leaving my hair looking shiny and healthy. The texture is rich and creamy, but it doesn’t weigh my hair down. I love how easy it is to rinse out, and my hair feels so much more manageable and silky smooth. It’s become a staple in my hair care routine, and I’ve noticed less frizz and more bounce.

It leaves my scalp feeling calm, soothed, and refreshed. The star for me is the Scalp Tonic — it gives a cooling sensation and helps stimulate circulation for healthier, stronger hair over time.\n\nUsing all three products together has made a noticeable difference in reducing hair fall and promoting growth.
